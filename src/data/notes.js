    content: `## Deal Overview
The HealthCare Pro expansion deal ($125K) is critical for Q4. Dr. Amanda Foster is our champion and strongly supports the platform, but CFO Thomas Reed is creating budget resistance.

## Key Stakeholders
- **Dr. Amanda Foster (CMO)** - Strong champion, sees platform as essential for hospital expansion
- **Thomas Reed (CFO)** - Budget gatekeeper, skeptical, needs ROI justification
- **CEO** - Supportive but deferring to CFO on budget decisions

## Budget Context
- Recent cost-cutting initiatives announced
- All new expenditures under scrutiny
- Need to position as revenue-generating, not cost center

## Competitive Landscape
- Epic MyChart is incumbent in some target hospitals
- Our advantage: better patient experience scores, easier integration

## Action Plan
1. Prepare comprehensive ROI analysis showing patient retention impact
2. Gather metrics from current deployment to demonstrate value
3. Support Dr. Foster with ammunition for CFO meeting
4. Consider phased implementation to reduce upfront cost

## Risk Level: Medium-High
Timeline pressure due to their Q1 expansion plans.`,

    title: "TechSolutions Negotiation Playbook",
    content: `## Negotiation Status
In final negotiation with TechSolutions ($87.5K). Decision expected by Dec 10.

## Key Decision Maker
David Kim (CTO) - Technical evaluator, impressed with product but price sensitive

## Competitive Situation
- **CompetitorX**: 30% cheaper, missing key API analytics features
- **CompetitorY**: Similar price, weaker documentation and support
- **Our advantage**: Superior API analytics, better developer experience

## Main Objection
Price comparison to CompetitorX

## Negotiation Strategy
1. **Focus on TCO, not license price** - CompetitorX has hidden implementation costs
2. **Highlight differentiators** - API analytics demo was very well received
3. **Multi-year discount** - Offer 10% for 3-year commitment
4. **Support SLAs** - Our response times are 3x faster than competitors

## Approach Recommendation
David is very technical and responds well to data. Prepare:
- Detailed TCO comparison (3-year view)
- API analytics feature comparison chart
- Customer references in SaaS industry

## Timeline
- Decision: Dec 10
- Pricing proposal due: Dec 2`,

$72K renewal AT RISK. Kevin O'Brien (VP Project Management) is frustrated with recent platform performance issues.

## Background
BuildWell has been a customer since 2023. They experienced performance issues during two major construction projects this fall, causing schedule delays.

1. **Immediate**: Schedule executive business review by Dec 5
2. **Acknowledge**: Own the performance issues honestly
3. **Remediate**: Present specific fixes and timeline
4. **Demonstrate**: Show value delivered over relationship
5. **Incentivize**: Consider retention discount if needed

## Key Message
We take responsibility for the issues. Here's what we've done to fix them, and here's the value we've delivered.

## Escalation
If Kevin won't engage, escalate to his VP or CEO. Bring our executive team.

## Timeline
- Dec 5: Executive business review
- Dec 15: Remediation plan delivered
- Jan 15: Renewal discussion

$135K Warehouse Management System - Champion secured, need CFO approval.

## Situation
Brian Thompson (VP Supply Chain) is a strong champion but he's not the budget holder. Need to get ROI story to CFO for approval.

## Champion Context
Brian is frustrated with their legacy system. He's a strong advocate for modernization but has been blocked before by finance.

## CFO Objection Anticipation
1. "Why now?" - Current system still works
2. "ROI timeline?" - How long to see return
3. "Implementation risk?" - Business disruption
4. "Competitor pricing?" - Manhattan Associates, Blue Yonder

## ROI Business Case
- 50 warehouses with average $500K inventory each
- 3% inventory carrying cost reduction = $750K annual savings
- 2% labor efficiency gain = $400K annual savings
- Total annual ROI: $1.15M vs $135K investment
- Payback: < 2 months

## Strategy for CFO Meeting (Dec 10)
1. Lead with business problem (legacy pain)
2. Present ROI analysis with conservative assumptions
3. Show TCO comparison vs competitors
4. Offer phased implementation to reduce risk
5. Reference customer testimonials

## Preparation
- Get Brian to brief CFO before meeting
- Prepare 1-page executive summary
- Have customer reference ready`,
