    content: `## Deal Overview
The HealthCare Pro expansion deal ($125K) is critical for Q4. Dr. Amanda Foster is our champion and strongly supports the platform, but CFO Thomas Reed is creating budget resistance.

## Key Stakeholders
- **Dr. Amanda Foster (CMO)** - Strong champion, sees platform as essential for hospital expansion
- **Thomas Reed (CFO)** - Budget gatekeeper, skeptical, needs ROI justification
- **CEO** - Supportive but deferring to CFO on budget decisions

## Budget Context
- Recent cost-cutting initiatives announced
- All new expenditures under scrutiny
- Need to position as revenue-generating, not cost center

## Competitive Landscape
- Epic MyChart is incumbent in some target hospitals
- Our advantage: better patient experience scores, easier integration

## Action Plan
1. Prepare comprehensive ROI analysis showing patient retention impact
2. Gather metrics from current deployment to demonstrate value
3. Support Dr. Foster with ammunition for CFO meeting
4. Consider phased implementation to reduce upfront cost

## Risk Level: Medium-High
Timeline pressure due to their Q1 expansion plans.`,

    title: "TechSolutions Negotiation Playbook",
    content: `## Negotiation Status
In final negotiation with TechSolutions ($87.5K). Decision expected by Dec 10.

## Key Decision Maker
David Kim (CTO) - Technical evaluator, impressed with product but price sensitive

## Competitive Situation
- **CompetitorX**: 30% cheaper, missing key API analytics features
- **CompetitorY**: Similar price, weaker documentation and support
- **Our advantage**: Superior API analytics, better developer experience

## Main Objection
Price comparison to CompetitorX

## Negotiation Strategy
1. **Focus on TCO, not license price** - CompetitorX has hidden implementation costs
2. **Highlight differentiators** - API analytics demo was very well received
3. **Multi-year discount** - Offer 10% for 3-year commitment
4. **Support SLAs** - Our response times are 3x faster than competitors

## Approach Recommendation
David is very technical and responds well to data. Prepare:
- Detailed TCO comparison (3-year view)
- API analytics feature comparison chart
- Customer references in SaaS industry

## Timeline
- Decision: Dec 10
- Pricing proposal due: Dec 2`,
